# Hotel_Booking_Python_EDA_Project üè®üìä

Introduction:
"During my data analysis project, I focused on addressing the high cancellation rates experienced by City Hotel and Resort Hotel. These cancellations were leading to reduced revenues and inefficient use of hotel rooms. My primary goal was to identify the key factors influencing hotel reservation cancellations and provide actionable insights to lower these rates."


Research Questions:
"To guide my analysis, I formulated these research questions:
What factors influence hotel reservation cancellations?
How can we reduce hotel reservation cancellations?
How can hotels make informed pricing and promotional decisions?"


Analysis and Findings:

Cancellation Percentage: "I analyzed reservation data and found that 37% of clients had cancelled their reservations, significantly impacting hotel earnings."

City vs. Resort Hotels: "City hotels had more bookings than resort hotels, possibly due to lower prices in cities."

Average Daily Rates: "On certain days, city hotel rates were lower than resort hotels, indicating that weekends and holidays might see increased resort hotel rates."

Monthly Reservations: "August had the highest number of reservations, while January had the most cancellations."

Price vs. Cancellation: "Cancellations were most common when prices were highest, suggesting that pricing is a key factor."

Top Cancellation Country: "Portugal had the highest number of reservation cancellations."

Booking Channels: "Around 46% of clients booked through online travel agencies, while only 4% booked directly at the hotels."



Suggestions:

Pricing Strategies: "To prevent cancellations, hotels could refine their pricing strategies. Offering discounts or lower rates for specific locations and timeframes could be effective."

Weekend Discounts: "Considering the higher cancellation ratio in resort hotels during weekends and holidays, offering reasonable discounts during these periods may help."

January Campaigns: "In March, hotels could launch marketing campaigns with attractive offers to boost revenue during the peak cancellation period."

Quality Improvement: "Focusing on enhancing hotel quality and services, particularly in Portugal, could reduce cancellation rates."


Conclusion:
"In conclusion, my analysis highlighted the critical factors affecting hotel reservation cancellations and provided actionable recommendations to address this issue. By implementing these strategies, hotels can improve their efficiency, reduce cancellations, and ultimately increase revenue."üè®üõåüåü
